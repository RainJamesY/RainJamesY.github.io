# 😊 About Me

Greetings!
I'm Dongyu Yao (姚栋宇), a senior undergraduate student at the [School of Cyber Science and Engineering](http://cse.whu.edu.cn/index.htm), [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/).  Prior to WHU, I spent three years studying at No.1 Middle School Affiliated to CCNU. My research interests broadly lie in Machine Learning, Computer Vision (data-efficient scene understanding), and Artificial Intelligence Security & Privacy.

# 🔬 Research Interest

- Machine learning and Computer Vision
  - Domain Adaptation/Transfer learning
  - Semi-supervised Learning
- Artificial Intelligence Security & Privacy
  - Security in Large Language Models (Natural Language Processing)
