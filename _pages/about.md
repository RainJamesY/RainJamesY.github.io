# üòä About Me

üëãGreetings!
I'm Dongyu (Rain) Yao (ÂßöÊ†ãÂÆá), a [Master&#39;s student in Computer Vision (**MSCV**)](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/education/academic-programs/master-of-science-computer-vision/) at Carnegie Mellon University. I obtained my Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) degree at the [School of Cyber Science and Engineering](http://cse.whu.edu.cn/index.htm), [Wuhan University (WHU)](https://www.whu.edu.cn/).  Prior to WHU, I spent three years studying at [No.1 Middle School Affiliated to CCNU (Âçé‰∏≠Â∏àÂ§ß‰∏ÄÈôÑ‰∏≠)](http://www.hzsdyfz.com.cn).

# üî¨ Research Interest

My research interests focus on **Data-centric AI** and **Reliable** (Multi-modal) **AI**, encompassing key areas in **Computer Vision** (data-efficient scene understanding), **Natural Language Processing**, and **Generative AI** (LLMs and MLLMs). Recently, I'm exploring **Multi-modal Reasoning and Alignment**, especially evaluation and de-hallucination for **Vision-language Models** with multi-image and video understanding capabilities.
