# 🤘 About Me

🤜🤛 Yo Wassup!

I'm Dongyu (Rain) Yao (姚栋宇), a [Master&#39;s student in Computer Vision (**MSCV**)](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/education/academic-programs/master-of-science-computer-vision/) at Carnegie Mellon University. I earned my Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) degree at the [School of Cyber Science and Engineering](http://cse.whu.edu.cn/index.htm), [Wuhan University (WHU)](https://www.whu.edu.cn/). Before that, I spent three wonderful years studying at [No.1 Middle School Affiliated to CCNU (华中师大一附中)](http://www.hzsdyfz.com.cn). 

Outside the lab and work, you’ll probably find me vibing to music or shooting hoops. I’m always down to a chat — feel free to reach out!

# 🔬 Research Interest

My research interests focus on **Data-centric AI** and **Reliable** (Multi-modal) **AI**, encompassing key areas in **Computer Vision** (data-efficient scene understanding), **Natural Language Processing**, and **Generative AI** (LLMs and MLLMs). Recently, I've been exploring **Multi-modal Reasoning and Alignment**, especially evaluation and de-hallucination for **Large Vision-language Models** with multi-image and video understanding capabilities.

## 🥁 Music Band & Symphony Orchestra

I've been playing percussion instruments for over 18 years — ever since I was 4. From symphony halls to rock stages, I’ve played across genres, including Jazz, Funk, Pop, and Chinese Folk. I’m proficient in a wide range of instruments used in orchestras and beyond, such as Snare Drum, Timpani, Bass Drum, Drum Kit, Cymbals, Triangle, Chimes, Glockenspiel, Vibraphone, Xylophone, Marimba, Tambourine, Conga, Gong, Clave, and more.

## 🎤 Voice & Eloquence

- I'm recently in love with **Hamilton** (the Broadway musical), I can rap or sing at least 15 songs in the play. And yes, *Guns and Ships*? No sweat.

- I discovered my passion for public speaking during junior high, after winning several championships in English speech contests.
- One of my favorite speeches is Lincoln’s **Gettysburg Address**, which I still revisit from time to time.
- I scored single-best 112 on TOEFL (**28** in speaking) and **330** on GRE (V162 + Q168 + W4.0). Daily speaking practice pays off.

## 🏀 Basketball

- I was the shooting guard for the WHU SCSE Men's Basketball Team back in undergrad.
